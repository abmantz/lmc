# LMC example usage

Files in this folder either reproduce (`.py`) or illustrate with a bit more discussion/plots (`.ipynb`) the examples that can be found in the `example()` code within LMC.

1. [Sampling a Gaussian I](simple_hoodClosed.py) (uses the `Vehicle` class; chain goes to `stdout`)
2. [Sampling a Gaussian II](simple_hoodOpen.py) (without using the `Vehicle` class; chain goes to a text file)
3. [Fitting a line + scatter](line.ipynb) (chains stored in Python dictionaries)
